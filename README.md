Slam Salam!
===========

This is a tiny browser game, that we’re using to assess basic JavaScript competencies, prior to an actual interview.



The Game
--------

[Salam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florin_Salam) wants to enter your house through one of the eight available doors, in order to sing [manele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manele). If you see him entering several doors at once, do not panic! That’s how he’s rolling when he feels the artistic urge. Though, once he’s succeeded entering through a door, the game is over.



Requirements
------------

Implement the following missing game feature: If the user clicks an open door, the door will close, preventing Salam from getting in. Note that it shouldn’t matter if Salam is already on the doorstep or not.

#### For bonus points:

1. Make it so that once a door has been closed by the user, Salam will be able to attempt entering it in the future. Numberless times.
* Count how many times Salam is denied, and display that number, in real time, as a score.
